Denwa Petto draws inspiration from the iconic Tamagotchi toy, integrating classic features such as nurturing a virtual pet and modern advancements, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and enhanced graphics. The mobile app was developed with JavaScript, React Native, HTML, CSS, and designed in Figma, offering compatibility for Android and IOS devices. Players can enjoy immersive experiences across the main game, story mode, and combat mode. In the main game, players interact, feed, and purchase items for their pets using in-game currency. The story mode enriches the experience by utilizing the OpenAI API, enabling players to engage in rich text conversations with an AI bot powered by ChatGPT and generate customizable images using Dall-E. The innovative step-tracking feature connects physical wellness to gameplay, with each step influencing the petâ€™s combat strength within the turn-based combat mode. We believe that immersing players in a fun virtual pet app while also promoting physical wellness through the step tracker will create a fulfilling and rewarding experience.
